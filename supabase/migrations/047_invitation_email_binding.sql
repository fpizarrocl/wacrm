-- 047_invitation_email_binding.sql
--
-- Binds each invitation to a specific email address. The invite
-- link stays a manually-shared secret (no email sending is
-- introduced here) — this migration adds a second factor on top
-- of the token: only the person signed in with the bound email
-- can redeem the link.
--
-- Nullable `email` column (not NOT NULL): a hot-deploy window
-- between shipping this migration and the API route that starts
-- requiring `email` could otherwise leave in-flight inserts
-- failing a NOT NULL constraint. "Email required" is enforced at
-- the application layer; `redeem_invitation` treats a NULL email
-- (any invite created before this shipped) as unrestricted, same
-- as today's behavior — those rows retire naturally via
-- `expires_at`.
--
-- Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.
-- ============================================================

-- auth.uid() context to check against anyway (it's anon-callable
-- by design, for visitors who haven't signed in yet).

--           is authenticated as (SQLSTATE class 28 =
--           invalid_authorization_specification; closest standard

-- addresses are conventionally treated case-insensitively and the
-- invite dialog already lowercases on insert.
